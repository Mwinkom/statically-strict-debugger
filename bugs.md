## üêû Bug Fix #1: Light Intensity Slider Not Working Responsively

### ‚úÖ Bug Description:
- The slider to increase/decrease room light intensity did not visually update the bulb brightness as expected.

- Even though the slider value changed, the light bulb image and brightness filter did not reflect the slider's movement.


### üîç How the Bug Was Discovered:
- Moving the slider had no effect on light intensity or bulb icon.
- Console debugging was used:
  - `console.log` inside `handleLightIntensitySlider` showed `componentData` as undefined.
  - `console.log(room)` inside `lightComponentSelectors` returned only the first character of the room name.
- Wrong room identifier was being passed to fetch data.

### üõ†Ô∏è Root Causes Identified:
1. **Wrong Room Name Selection:**
```ts
const room = this.getSelectedComponentName(lightButtonElement);
const componentData = this.getComponent(room[0]);  // Bug: only first character used
```
- This passed 'h' instead of 'hall' causing undefined data.


### ü©∫ Debugging Techniques Used:
- Added console logs in `lightComponentSelectors` and `getComponent` to trace values.
- Verified DOM selectors and slider event listeners in browser dev tools.

### ‚úÖ Final Fixes Applied:
#### Corrected Component Selection:
```ts
const room = this.getSelectedComponentName(lightButtonElement);
const componentData = this.getComponent(room);  // ‚úÖ Correct fix
```

#### Fixed Light Switch Update Logic:
```ts
handleLightIntensitySlider(element: HTMLElement, intensity: number): void {
    const { componentData } = this.lightComponentSelectors(element);

    if (typeof intensity !== 'number' || isNaN(intensity)) return;

    componentData.lightIntensity = intensity;

    const lightSwitch = this.closestSelector(element, '.rooms', '.light-switch') as HTMLElement | null;
    if (!lightSwitch) return;

    componentData.isLightOn = intensity > 0;
    this.sliderLight(componentData.isLightOn, lightSwitch);
}
```

## üêû Bug Fix #2: Light Switch For Each Room not responding when clicked
### ‚úÖ Bug Description:
The light bulb remained off or did not respond when clicked for the respective rooms.

### üõ†Ô∏è Root Causes Identified:
 **Incorrect Light Switch State Update:**
- `componentData.isLightOn = false;` was forcing lights off even when slider was above 0.



### ‚úÖ Final Fixes Applied:
#### Before:
```ts
componentData.isLightOn = false;
```

#### Fixed Light Switch Update Logic:
```ts
if (intensity === 0) {
            componentData.isLightOn = false;
        } else {
            componentData.isLightOn = true;
        }
```
## üêû Bug Fix #3: Automated Time Display Not Updating in Advanced Settings

### ‚úÖ Bug Description:
When a user selected a custom **Automatic On** or **Automatic Off** time from the advanced settings modal, the displayed time values were **not updating** in the UI, even though the internal component data was updated.
- The input field accepted the time.

- However, the <span> showing Automatic turn on: --:-- did not reflect the new time.

- No visible feedback was shown to the user after setting a time.


### üîç How the Bug Was Discovered:
- Manual testing showed the modal inputs worked, but visual display remained unchanged.
- Using `console.log` on the component data verified that:
  - The new time was correctly assigned to `component.autoOn` or `component.autoOff`.
  - However, the DOM `<span>` elements displaying the time were not updating.first character of the room name.
- Further inspection of the function showed the following issue:
    - The input values were being checked with

    ```ts
    if (!!value) return;
    ```
    - This prevented valid input values from being processed.


### üõ†Ô∏è Root Causes Identified:
1. **Inverted Logical Condition:**
The code was returning early when a value was present (truthy), which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Buggy snippet:

```ts
if (!!value) return;  // ‚ùå Incorrect: prevents valid values from updating
```

- The condition should have been:

```ts
if (!value) return;  // ‚úÖ Correct: skip only if value is empty/falsy
```
- Because of this, even valid times were never updating the UI display spans.


### ‚úÖ Final Fixes Applied:

Reversed the faulty condition to allow valid values through:

#### Before (Buggy) :
```ts
if (!!value) return;
```

#### After (Fixed) :
```ts
if (!value) return;
```
#### Fully Fixed Method :
```ts
customizeAutomaticOnPreset(selectedElement: HTMLElement): void {
    const element = this.closestSelector(selectedElement, '.defaultOn', 'input') as HTMLInputElement | null;
    if (!element || !element.value) return;

    const component = this.getComponentData(element, '.advanced_features', '.component_name');
    component.autoOn = element.value;
    element.value = '';

    const spanElement = this.selector('.auto_on > span:last-child') as HTMLElement | null;
    if (spanElement) this.updateMarkupValue(spanElement, component.autoOn);

    this.setComponentElement(component);
    this.automateLight(component['autoOn'], component);
}

customizeAutomaticOffPreset(selectedElement: HTMLElement): void {
    const element = this.closestSelector(selectedElement, '.defaultOff', 'input') as HTMLInputElement | null;
    if (!element || !element.value) return;

    const component = this.getComponentData(element, '.advanced_features', '.component_name');
    component.autoOff = element.value;
    element.value = '';

    const spanElement = this.selector('.auto_off > span:last-child') as HTMLElement | null;
    if (spanElement) this.updateMarkupValue(spanElement, component.autoOff);

    this.setComponentElement(component);
    this.automateLight(component['autoOff'], component);
}

```
